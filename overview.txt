Section 14: Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview

	- up until this point, all data that our program accesses
	  is via memory

		+ scope and variety of applications you can create
		  is limited

	- all serious business applications require more data than
	  would fit into main memory

		+ also depends on the ability to process data that
		  is persistent and stored on an external device
		  such as a disk drive

	- C provides many functions in the header file stdio.h
	  for writing to and reading from external devices

		+ the external device you would use for storing
		  and retrieving data is typically a disk drive

		+ however, the library will work with virtually 
		  any external storage device

	- with all the examples up to now, any data that the user
	  enters is lost once the program ends (volatile data)

		+ if the user wants to run the program with the
		  same data, he or she must enter it again each
		  time

		+ very inconvenient and limits programming

		+ referred to as volatile data


Files

	- programs need to store data on permanent storage

		+ called non-volatile data

		+ continues to be maintained after your
		  computer is turned off

	- a file can store non-volatile data and is usually
	  stored on a disk or a solid-state device

		+ a named section of storage

		+ stdio.h is a file containing useful
		  information

	- C views a file as a continuous sequence of bytes

		+ each byte can be read individually
		
		+ corresponds to the file structure in the
		  Unix environment


Files (continued)

	- a file has a beginning and an end and a current
	  position (defined as so many bytes from the
	  beginning)

	- the current position is where any file action
	  (read/write) will take place

		+ you can move the current position to
		  any point in the file (even the end)


Text and Binary Files

	- there are two ways of writing data to a stream
	  that represents a file

		+ text

		+ binary

	- text data is written as a sequence of characters
	  organized as lines (each line ends with a
	  newline)

	- binary data is written as a series of bytes
	  exactly as they appear in memory

		+ image data, music encoding - not
		  readable

	- you can write any data you like to a file

		+ once a file has been written, it just
		  consists of a series of bytes

	- you have to understand the format of the file
	  in order to read it

		+ a sequence of 12 bytes in a binary
		  file could be 12 characters, 12
		  8-bit signed integers, 12 8-bit
		  unsigned integers, etc.

		+ in binary mode, each and every byte
		  of the file is accessible


Streams

	- C programs automatically open three files on
	  your behalf

		+ standard input - the normal input
		  device for your system, usually your
		  keyboard

		+ standard output - usually your display
		  screen

		+ standard error - usually your display
		  screen

	- standard input is the file that is read by
	  getchar(), puts(), and scanf()

	- standard output is used by putchar(), puts(),
	  and printf()

		+ redirection causes other files to be
		  recognized as the standard input or
		  standard output

	- the purpose of the standard error output file
	  is to provide a logically distinct place to 
	  send error messages

	- a stream is an abstract representation of
	  any external source or destination for data

		+ the keyboard, the command line on 
		  your display, and files on a disk
		  are all examples of things you can
		  work with as streams

		+ the C library provides functions for
		  reading and writing to or from data
		  streams

			- you use the same input/
			  output functions for reading
			  and writing any external
			  device that is mapped to a
			  stream
